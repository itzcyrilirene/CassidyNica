## Creating Commands

### Command Structure

A command in CassidyRedux is typically defined in a JavaScript file with the following structure:

```javascript
export const meta = {
    name: "example",
    otherNames: ["ex", "examples"],
    author: "Author's Name",
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: "This is an example command used in demonstration.",
    usage: "{prefix}{name}",
    category: "Examples",
    noPrefix: "both",
    permissions: [0, 1, 2],
    botAdmin: false,
    waitingTime: 10,
    ext_plugins: {
        output: "^1.0.0"
    },
    whiteList: [
        "id1",
        "id2"
    ],
    args: [
        {
            degree: 0,
            fallback: null,
            response: "You cannot use this argument",
            search: "disallowedArg",
            required: false,
        }
    ],
    supported: "^1.0.0"
};

export async function entry({ input, output }) {
    output.reply('Hello, this is an example command!');
}
```

### Meta Options

The `meta` object contains important configuration information for the command. Here are the available options:

- **name**: The primary name of the command.
- **otherNames**: An array of alternative names for the command.
- **author**: The author of the command.
- **version**: The version of the command.
- **description**: A brief description of what the command does.
- **usage**: Instructions on how to use the command.
- **category**: The category under which the command falls.
- **noPrefix**: Specifies whether the command can be used without a prefix. Possible values are "both", true, or false.
- **permissions**: An array specifying the required permissions to use the command. (0: non-admin, 1: gc admin, 2: bot admin)
- **botAdmin**: A boolean indicating whether the command requires bot admin permissions.
- **waitingTime**: The cooldown time (in seconds) before the command can be used again.
- **ext_plugins**: An object specifying external plugins required by the command.
- **whiteList**: An array of user IDs that are allowed to use the command.
- **args**: An array of argument configurations. Each argument can have the following properties:
  - **degree**: The degree of the argument.
  - **fallback**: The fallback value if the argument is not provided.
  - **response**: The response message if the argument is not allowed.
  - **search**: The search term for the argument.
  - **required**: A boolean indicating whether the argument is required.
- **supported**: The supported version of the command.

### Context Variables

When defining the `entry` function for your command, you have access to several context variables:

- **input**: The input object containing information about the command invocation.
  - **input.text**: The text of the command.
  - **input.senderID**: The ID of the user who sent the command.
  - **input.threadID**: The ID of the thread where the command was sent.
  - **input.arguments**: An array of arguments passed to the command.
  - **input.isAdmin**: A boolean indicating whether the user is an admin.
  - **input.replier**: The replier object if the command is a reply.
- **output**: The output object used to send responses back to the user.
  - **output.reply(text)**: Sends a reply to the user.
  - **output.error(err)**: Sends an error message to the user.
  - **output.send(text, id)**: Sends a message to a specific user or thread.
  - **output.add(user, thread)**: Adds a user to a thread.
  - **output.kick(user, thread)**: Kicks a user from a thread.
  - **output.unsend(mid)**: Unsend a message by its ID.
  - **output.reaction(emoji, mid)**: Reacts to a message with an emoji.
- **event**: The event object containing details about the event that triggered the command.
- **api**: The API object for interacting with the platform (e.g., sending messages).
- **commandName**: The name of the command being executed.
- **args**: An array of arguments passed to the command.

### Example Command

Here is a more detailed example of a command that uses various meta options and context variables:

```javascript
export const meta = {
    name: "greet",
    otherNames: ["hello", "hi"],
    author: "Author's Name",
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: "Sends a greeting message.",
    usage: "{prefix}greet [name]",
    category: "General",
    noPrefix: "both",
    permissions: [0],
    botAdmin: false,
    waitingTime: 5,
    ext_plugins: {
        output: "^1.0.0"
    },
    whiteList: null,
    args: [
        {
            degree: 0,
            fallback: "User",
            response: "You need to provide a name.",
            search: "name",
            required: false,
        }
    ],
    supported: "^1.0.0"
};

export async function entry({ input, output, args }) {
    const name = args[0] || "User";
    output.reply(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
