  - See the main repo [here](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api).

  #### Example Usage

  ```javascript
  const login = require("fb-chat-api-temp");

  // Create simple echo bot
  login({email: "FB_EMAIL", password: "FB_PASSWORD"}, (err, api) => {
      if(err) return console.error(err);

      api.listen((err, message) => {
          api.sendMessage(message.body, message.threadID);
      });
  });
  ```

- **Styler Handler**: A JavaScript utility designed to apply dynamic styling to text content.
  
  #### Example Usage
